# Home-Price-Prediction-Analysis
Project Summary :- Home Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting property prices using Linear Regression. The dataset includes various property-related features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, land size, and building area. The goal is to train a model that can accurately estimate housing prices based on these attributes.

Project Details:

Data Processing:- The dataset is loaded using Pandas. Unnecessary columns such as Address, Date, Postcode, YearBuilt, Latitude, and Longitude are dropped.

Missing values in numerical columns like Landsize and BuildingArea are filled with their respective mean. Other missing values in categorical/numeric columns are filled with 0.

The dataset is converted into a machine-learning-friendly format using one-hot encoding.

Developed Various dataset such as Linear Reggression,Lasso,Ridge and also obtained different score such as mean absolute score ,r2 score,mean squared score.
